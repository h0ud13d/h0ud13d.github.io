That saying never sat right with me. The timerange of 2 weeks-3 months is enough to become better than 2 standard deviations above the mean on a certain thing. I feel that too many people today are getting [wireheaded](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/wireheading) and struggle with keeping a long mental focus of >2 weeks on a certain project; nethertheless 2-3 hours on a certain task. 

I experienced this recently with a close family member, who had offloaded all of their thinking / searching / investigating to LLMs. 100% of their brain power, what outfits to wear, what to eat for dinner, how to turn on a dishwasher. The fucking *Start* button is right there! I do wonder what learning will be like (if humans still need to do that) in 10 years. I imagine the mental fortitude of those teenagers and young adults would be as strong as paper mache. 

Would that future be evolution taking it course? Do we need to stop that from happening if that's our destiny, to become [Axiom humans](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Axiom_Humans), flesh goon bots for [AI generated Russian step sisters](https://x.com/ParikPatelCFA/status/1956748490396352906)?

Not up to me to answer, but I do hope we pivot from that future.
