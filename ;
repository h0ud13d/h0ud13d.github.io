The saying > "people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade" never sat right with me. I believe the range of 2 weeks -> 3 months is enough to become better than 2 standard deviations above the mean on a certain thing. I feel that too many people today are getting [wireheaded](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/wireheading) and struggle with keeping a long mental focus of >2 weeks on a certain project.
